This image displays the count of bikes that are being used based on time intervals of hour. This data shows nearly every bike ride was under one hour and ultimately lasted between zero and thirty minutes. This is important to understand, as bike transportation is use mostly for a means to an end. From one point to another. From A to B. Therefore, it is vital that we put CitiBike in a location that has many resources (resturants, attractions, shops, etc.) in a centralized location in Des Moines.
