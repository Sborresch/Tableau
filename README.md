This image displays the count of bikes that are being used based on time intervals of hour. This data shows nearly every bike ride was under one hour and ultimately lasted between zero and thirty minutes. This is important to understand, as bike transportation is use mostly for a means to an end. From one point to another. From A to B. Therefore, it is vital that we put CitiBike in a location that has many resources (resturants, attractions, shops, etc.) in a centralized location in Des Moines.

This data shows nearly every bike ride was under one hour and ultimately lasted between zero and thirty minutes. This is important to understand, as bike transportation is use mostly for a means to an end. From one point to another. From A to B. Therefore, it is vital that we put CitiBike in a location that has many resources (resturants, attractions, shops, etc.) in a centralized location in Des Moines. In addition, this shows that primarily male users rented bikes from CitiBike NY. This could finetune our target market of males users in central Des Moines.

## Heatmap by Hour and Day

This image displays at what times and days CityBike users are most frequently using the services in NY. According to this data, the most busy usage times are during:
- Thursdays at 8:00am and between 5:00pm-6:00pm
- Monday & Tuesdays between 5:00pm-6:00pm
- Friday at 5:00pm

This is likely when we should advertise the most, have limited unused bike supply, and avoid these times for repairs and fixes of the bikes.

## Heatmap by User, Day, and Gender
![Screenshot](https://github.com/Sborresch/Tableau/blob/main/Heatmap_By_User%2BDay%2BGender.png)
This image displays that the male population is a repeat visitor to the CitiBike brand because they have purchased a subscription to the survice. The female population is slightly more subscriber than customer (one off user). Those users who did not disclose a gender are mostly one off customers of CitiBike. Because subsribers make up a large portion of frequent usage and profit, it is important to know when they are using the bikes, why they are using them, and how they are using them.

# Summary
## Summary of Results
Based on the data collected from New York users of the CitiBike brand both the angel investors and the two women starting up the company can determine the best location for CitiBike usage, the ideal target market, most common days and times the bikes are used, when to service the bikes, and where proper pick up and drop off locations should be located.

These dashboards and preliminary data should prove substantial to all stakeholders to foster a healthy CitiBike brand in the Des Moines, Iowa area.

## Additional Visualization - Purpose
It could prove very beneficial to understand why customers and subsribers of all demographics use the CitiBike services? Is it to avoid traffic, visit a friend, carryout arrands, helps those with no vehicles, get exercise, etc. This type of data could be collected by CitiBike companies across the nation through a simple survey at the end of the expeience through the app. Although this data would not be required to use the service, it can help paint a bigger picture of the users of CitiBike.

## Additional Visualization - Age Group by Purpose
To extend the first additional visualization reccomendation, it could be helpful to tie the purpose of CitiBike users and their age. If majority of all male users (the biggest target market based on data) uses it to run errands and are considered in the senior citizen group (65+ in age), then the company can market towards them to improve their experience with CitiBike. For example, we could:
- Add baskets to the bikes to hold items to and from errands
- Put more bikes by doctors offices, pharmacies, and grocery stores
- Adjust the comfortablity of the bikes seat, handle bars, and height from the ground to accomodate senior citizens
